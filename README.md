INDUSTRY ORIENTED AUTOMATION ROBOT

->Hardware devices: Battery, Fire sensor, Switch , Gas sensor, ESP 32 , Metal sensor, DC Motor ,Magnet, Ultrasonic Sensor, LDR sensor, regulator.

->Softwares : Telegram Bot, Wifi modulation, Arduino IDE

-> Main Idea : It features advanced sensors such as an LDR, three ultra-sonic sensors, a fire sensor, a gas sensor and a metal sensor. The robot can pick up tiny metal pieces on the floor with a magnet, making it an asset in facilities
that handle metal parts. One of the key features of this robot is its connectivity to a Telegram bot. The robot sends alerts to the bot if any abnormal values are detected by its sensors. This real-time monitoring allows for quick and
efficient responses to potential hazards. The LDR allows for adaptation to changing light conditions, and the ultrasonic sensors provide 360-degree coverage around the robot, enabling obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
The fire sensor and gas sensor ensure a safe working environment by detecting potential hazards, while the metal sensor and magnet make it easy to remove metal debris from the floor.

-> Working: 
   1) Fire detection by Fire Sensor
   2) Gas detection by Gas Sensor
   3) Light detection by LDR Sensor
   4) Metal detection by Metal Sensor
   5) Obstacle Detection by Ultrasonic Sensor
   6) Collection of metal particle by Magnet Sensor

-> Objectives:
  1)improve safety
  2) enhance efficiency
  3) improve quality
  4) provide real-time monitoring
  5) offer adaptability
  6) remove metal debris

-> Results:
This robot can be used to monitor the industrial environment using sensors that perform particular tasks. If any abnormal values were measured in sensors, the robot sent an alert to the Telegram bot.Based on values measured
in IoT, particular measures willbe taken by the user to avoid accidents.
